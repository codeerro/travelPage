        <p class="first">Last winter, I had the chance to visit Cox’s Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world. It was one of the most refreshing and exciting trips I’ve ever taken. We started our journey from Dhaka on a night bus, and after hours of travel and laughter with friends, we finally reached our destination at sunrise.

As soon as I saw the vast blue sea meeting the golden sand, I felt all my stress melt away. The sound of the waves crashing and the soft breeze made the moment magical. We checked into a beachside hotel, dropped off our bags, and ran straight to the beach.

We spent the day walking along the shore, collecting seashells, taking photos, and enjoying the local food. The dried fish market and street-side "fuchka" were amazing! During the evening, the sunset painted the sky with orange and purple — it was truly breathtaking.

One of the highlights of the trip was visiting Himchari and Inani Beach. The view from the Himchari hilltop was stunning, and Inani’s coral-stone beach gave us a new experience. We also rode quad bikes and took a speedboat ride, which was both thrilling and fun.

At night, we sat by the beach, listening to the waves, singing songs, and sharing stories. It felt like time had slowed down just for us.</p><button>Read More</button>

        I returned home with sand in my shoes and countless memories in my heart.</b></p>

<P>Listening to songs while traveling is one of the best ways to enhance the journey. 
    Whether it's on a long road trip, a train ride through the countryside, or a flight above the clouds, music adds a special rhythm to the experience.
     It sets the mood, helps pass the time, and creates memories that last. 
    Often, a particular song can instantly bring back the feeling of a place or moment, making travel more meaningful and emotionally rich. </P>
